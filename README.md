Abstract

Introduction of deep learning has significantly transformed medical research, offering powerful and disease specific capabilities that have proven invaluable across numerous healthcare applications. One of the most impactful areas has been in the detection of lung cancer, where deep learning particularly through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) has revolutionized diagnostic approaches. These advanced techniques have drastically improved the accuracy and efficiency of identifying lung cancer nodules in CT scan images. In our project, we harness the remarkable potential of deep learning to distinguish between cancerous and non cancerous lung nodules, utilizing CT scan images as our primary data source. To enhance prediction accuracy and model robustness, we implemented an ensemble strategy that integrates multiple CNN architectures. This approach allows for a more analysis by utilizing various models’ advantages. The dataset we employed, which is publicly available and contains expertly annotated CT scan images, served as a foundation for our deep learning model. For optimal training and evaluation, we carefully partitioned the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring a systematic assessment of our model’s performance. Our ensemble model, referred to as LungNet incorporates three distinct CNNs, each designed with varying numbers of layers, kernel sizes, and pooling strategies to capture diverse feature representations. Through this architecture, we were able to measure both training and validation accuracies, highlighting the model’s effectiveness. To further explore optimal performance, we investigated deeper CNN architectures such as ResNet50 and VGG16, which are known for their superior feature extraction and classification capabilities in complex image recognition tasks. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the profound capabilities of deep learning in the field of medical imaging and its potential to contribute significantly to early and accurate lung cancer diagnosis.

Proposed System

The proposed system aims to build an efficient deep learning pipeline for the early detection of lung cancer using 2D CT scan images. Initially, CT scan images are collected and undergo preprocessing steps, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting. The preprocessed dataset is then split into training and testing sets. Three different deep learning models CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50 are designed and trained individually on the same dataset to ensure fair performance comparison. The CNN model serves as a baseline to capture low- to mid-level features, while VGG16, known for its depth and structured feature maps, enhances fine-grained feature extraction. ResNet50, utilizing residual learning, enables training of very deep networks without performance degradation, thereby improving model robustness. Each model is evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics. Finally, performance visualization is conducted by plotting accuracy and loss curves for all three models to determine the most effective approach for lung cancer detection and prediction. This multi-model comparison strategy ensures a comprehensive evaluation and provides insights into the optimal model for clinical application.

The developed deep learning models—CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50 were successfully trained and evaluated on a dataset of 2D CT scan images categorized into cancer and no lung cancer cases. Each model was trained using preprocessed and augmented image data to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. Performance was measured using a variety of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve). 
The CNN model, which was custom-built from scratch, achieved an accuracy of approximately 97%, with a precision of 92%, recall of 99%, and F1-score of 96%. While relatively simple, the CNN model proved to be effective at identifying patterns in the 2D CT images.
The VGG16 model, leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, performed better than the base CNN. It achieved an accuracy of around 95%, with a precision of 86%, recall of 99%, and F1-score of 92%. The VGG16 model showed robustness in distinguishing between cancer and no cancer nodules, likely due to its deeper architecture and better feature extraction capabilities.
The ResNet50 model demonstrated the good performance among all models tested. It achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 94%, with a precision of 86%, recall of 96%, and F1-score of 91%. Additionally, its AUC score was 0.97, indicating excellent discriminatory power between the two classes. The residual connections in ResNet50 helped mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allowed it to learn more complex features from the images.
